![Sounds](assets/readme-imgs/sounds.PNG)

## Score Counter

The score counter captures the current score that the user managed to play. This encourages the user to replay the game to try and break their recent high-score.
<br>
![Score counter](assets/readme-imgs/new-score-counter.PNG)

## Game over SweetAlert

The game over SweetAlert function tells the user that the gaming session has ended. Informing them that they collided with the obstacle, thus ending the game. It displays the highest score that the user reached, as well as a "Try Again" button which gives the user the choice to refresh and replay the game.
![Game over alert](assets/readme-imgs/new-game-over-modal.PNG)

## Instructions Modal

The instructions modal informs the user about the possible ways to control the player, while holding the game on pause. It displays two images with short descriptions underneath each image. The first image displays a left mouse button and the second image displays a arrow up button.
![Instructions Modal](assets/readme-imgs/new-instructions-modal.PNG)

## Victory Modal

The victory modal congratulates the player on successfully completing the journey. It informs the player of their achievement with an uplifting message and an icon.The overall design and content of the modal aim to create a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction for the player's successful completion of the game.

# Design

## Typography

The typography was chosen because it gives the user nice and clean feedback (e.g. score), without distracting them from the actual gameplay.
The fonts Merriweather and News Cycle from [Google fonts](<https://fonts.google.com/>) have been applied to this website.

## Color scheme

The color scheme was chosen to represent a landscape which the player travels through. The brown color under the player stands for the ground and the lightblue color in the background represents the sky. The WCAG color contrast checker extension for Chrome was used to determine fitting colors.

# Testing

## Validator Testing

The [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/), [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) and [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) were used to validate the project.
The validation results are displayed with a snippet of the code to indicate their association with the respective page.

### HTML Validator

### JSHint

- Validator result for script.js
![Validator result script](assets/readme-imgs/js-validator.PNG)
JSHint outputs 29 warnings which are considered aceptable. They are:
1. 	'let' is available in ES6 (use 'esversion: 6') or Mozilla JS extensions (use moz).

2.  'const' is available in ES6 (use 'esversion: 6') or Mozilla JS extensions (use moz).
<br>

3.  'arrow function syntax (=>)' is only available in ES6 (use 'esversion: 6').

## Lighthouse Testing

The website was tested using Lighthouse in Chrome DevTools throughout the development to check performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO. The final test on Lighthouse was run on incognito mode.

### Device Testing

Functionality, layout, and responsiveness were tested on the following devices and screens with issues in the collision detection:
This game was optimized for 1920px x 1080px screens.

- Lenovo Monitor 2560px x 1440px
- Samsung Monitor 1920px x 1080px
- Samsung Galaxy S9 1440px x 2960px
- iPhone 11 1792px x 828px

### Browser Compatibility

Testing has been carried out on the following browsers:
- Chrome Version 118.0.5993.117/118
- Safari Version 17.1
- Edge Version 118.0.2088.76
- Firefox Version 119.0

## Fixed Bugs

* Bug: Score on screen and score on SweetAlert show different numbers (SweetAlert score is 1 higher)

* Tried solutions:
1. Use ++sec instead of sec++
2. ClearInterval of the setInterval for the updateScore function
3. Updating the score again after clearing the intervals by getting the score from the dom

* Working solution: Decrement the value of "sec" by 1 with --sec

## Known Bugs

* The player sometimes collides with the obstacle without touching it.
Therefore leading to the player being either stuck in the "air" or getting back to the ground infront of the obstacle and triggering a game over.

# Deployment

## How to Deploy

Website deployment is the process of making a website live and accessible on the internet for people to visit.

1. Log into GitHub.
2. Locate repository (left-side or top-right icon and then on "Your repositories").
3. Select repository and navigate to "Settings" on the horizontal bar.
4. Open the "Pages" menu and select "main" for the branch.
5. The page will refresh with a link to the deployed website.
6. It may not go live for a few minutes, refresh the page to update the link.
7. Once deployed, the live website will automatically update when any changes are pushed to the main branch.

## How to Fork

Forking allows you to create a copy of the original repository in your own GitHub account. This enables you to make changes to the code without affecting the original code.

1. Log into GitHub.
2. Locate repository and select the repository.
3. Select the "Fork" button near the top-right.
4. You should now have a new copy of the original repository in your own GitHub account.

## How to Clone

Cloning allows you to make an exact copy of a code repository, usually for collaboration or to work on different features independently.

1. Log into GitHub.
2. Locate repository and select the repository.
3. Click the green "<> Code" button.
4. If you want to clone using HTTPS, select the copy button in the HTTPS menu.
5. Open Git Bash.
6. Change the current working directory to the location where you want your cloned directory to be.
7. Type "git clone", and then paste the URL you copied earlier and press "Enter".
